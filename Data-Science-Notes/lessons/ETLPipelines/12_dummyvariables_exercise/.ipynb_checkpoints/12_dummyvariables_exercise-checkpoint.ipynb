    "# Dummy Variables Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll create dummy variables from the projects data set. The idea is to transform categorical data like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Project ID | Project Category |\n",
    "|------------|------------------|\n",
    "| 0          | Energy           |\n",
    "| 1          | Transportation   |\n",
    "| 2          | Health           |\n",
    "| 3          | Employment       |\n",
    "\n",
    "into new features that look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Project ID | Energy | Transportation | Health | Employment |\n",
    "|------------|--------|----------------|--------|------------|\n",
    "| 0          | 1      | 0              | 0      | 0          |\n",
    "| 1          | 0      | 1              | 0      | 0          |\n",
    "| 2          | 0      | 0              | 1      | 0          |\n",
    "| 3          | 0      | 0              | 0      | 1          |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note if you were going to use this data with a model influenced by multicollinearity, you would want to eliminate one of the columns to avoid redundant information.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning behind these transformations is that machine learning algorithms read in numbers not text. Text needs to be converted into numbers. You could assign a number to each category like 1, 2, 3, and 4. But a categorical variable has no inherent order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas makes it very easy to create dummy variables with the [get_dummies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html) method. In this exercise, you'll create dummy variables from the World Bank projects data; however, there's a caveat. The World Bank data is not particularly clean, so you'll need to explore and wrangle the data first.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll focus on the text values in the sector variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cells below to read in the World Bank projects data set and then to filter out the data for text variables. "
